### Assignment
**Due 1/25**
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)
3. Make Digital Ocean Account  

**there are two ways you can do this:**  

option 1) Sign up for the [github student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack?utm_source=github+digitalocean) -- this takes a bit longer and has a few more steps (such as taking a photo of your student id and using your student email in your github account). then use github to login and create your digital ocean account.  

option 2) Use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/c57ec6b3cb5f) -- i will absolutely be transparent that if you continue to use and spend money on digital ocean that i might get money from this, but it has fewer steps than the github student developer pack.

in both these cases you get $200 for 60 days which means the first two months will be covered, and you only will be spending $10 for the rest of the semester. if this doesn't work for you, please let me know and we can go through alternatives! if you choose to not use either of these options, i can't guarantee the max $10 for the final two months. either way, consider this the textbook cost of the class.
