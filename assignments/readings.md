# Reading Responses
Reading responses are due at the start of class on the date assigned on the list below.

You may turn in a response up to one week late, for a one letter grade deduction off the project grade. Work that is more than one week late will not be accepted, meaning an automatic F on that project. If you are absent, you are still expected to turn in projects online by the deadline.

You can turn in your project by adding a link to it in this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I4rMb-gg-LCbdFIfDhe7uzGNk5gqZN4I2E5XjWZsquM/edit#gid=1715658920).
